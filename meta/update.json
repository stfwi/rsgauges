Reduces server re- calculations, but has the drawback that light-level-overlay shows not the same values on the client as used on the server.\n[M] Improved local light sensor autoswitch: Initial threshold values 7(on) and 6(off), fitting to spawn risk values. If on- and off-threshold are the same, the switch now activates on exactly that light level.\n[F] Redstone dust tracks don't show connections to wall-mount switches.\n[M] Switches are attachable to pistons, and pop off when pushed.\n[A] Implemented localisation support (some open tasks left, like localized day time representation of the timer clock; and seconds of the interval timers are arabic numbers because localisation files do not support %.02f format etc.). German language file updated.\n[M] Changed sensitive glass dynamic light level mod config to constant light level config for the server, means it is opt-in now, not opt-out. Reason is to priorise correct light-level- overlay over performance tuning.",
