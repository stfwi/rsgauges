                     to the entity detection switch.
                 [M] German language file updated.

    - v1.1.1-b1  [F] Fixed block notification issue when destroying contact plates
                     while standing on them.

                     sides implemented.
                 [A] Accepted wrenches (default: redstone torch) allow to configure
                     switch outputs with a single (activation) right click in addition
                     to empty handed left-double-click. (Feature added for creative
                     mode and configuration of many switches).

                 -------------------------------------------------------------------
    - v1.1.0     [R] Release based on v1.1.0-b4.
                 -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - v1.1.0-b4  [A] Added recipe system based opt-out (intended to facilitate
                     mod packing); added optionally omitting registration of
                     opt'ed out features (for trouble shooting and development).
                 [A] Added with-experimental opt-in config.
                 [A] Added mod specific registration and config based recipe condition.
                 [M] Indicator state range reduced (RAM/performance optimisation).
                 [M] Internal changes to prepare future mod features (see repository).

                     of the mod (CTRL-SHIFT when mouse hovering in the inventory

                 [A] Mod jar signing implemented.
                 [M] Version naming compliancy (removed 'mc' prefix in version strings).
                 [M] Forge naming convention refractoring of classes.

                 -------------------------------------------------------------------
    - v1.0.5     [R] Release based on v1.0.5b2.
                 -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - v1.0.5-b2  [F] Debounced link pearl cycling when creating a link pearl
                     from an Ender pearl.

                 [A] Added inverse output state switch linking feature.

    - v1.0.5-b1  [A] Added switch linking subsystem.
                 [A] Added switch link pearl, used to link and remote activate
                     switches. Created by left-clicking a switch with an Ender
                     pearl.
                 [A] Added switch linking of pulse and bi-stable switches. Both
                     can be link sources and link targets.
                 [A] Added switch linking of contact switches. All can be link
                     sources, the shock-sensitive trapdoor switch can be source
                     and target (only the most insensitive one).
                 [A] Added switch linking of automatic switches. All can be link
                     sources, except the interval timer, which can be a link
                     target.
                 [A] Added switch link trigger configurations: default trigger,
                     source activation trigger, source deactivation trigger,
                     and source toggle trigger.
                 [M] Interval timer start condition consistency fixed (from
                     standby to run mode the switch resets internal values).
                 [F] Interval timer output inversion corrected to be not affected
                     by standby/run state.

                 -------------------------------------------------------------------
    - v1.0.4     [R] Release based on v1.0.4b2.
                 -------------------------------------------------------------------

    - v1.0.4-b2  [A] Added industrial shock sensitive contact mat (pulses when
                     something falls upon).
                 [A] Added rustic shock sensitive contact plate (pulses when
                     fallen upon).
                 [A] Added industrial and rustic trapdoor switch (opens and pulses
                     when fallen upon).
                 [A] Added industrial and rustic high sensitive trapdoor switch
                     (opens and pulses when fallen upon or walked on, except
                     when sneaking).
                 [A] Added industrial and rustic counter trapdoor switch (pulses
                     when items or any entities fall through).

    - v1.0.4-b1  [A] Added switch status message overlay (replaces chat messages).
                 [A] Added industrial shock sensor contact mat (fall-on detector).
                 [A] Added rustic full size contact plate.
                 [M] Double click switch config shows the current config
                     at the first double click, after that the config is cycled.
                     Added this because the standard use case is to first inspect
                     the config and then optionally change it.
                 [M] Block-pop-off-check for gauges and switches check for
                     AIR and any liquid now, not just for air, water, lava.
                 [M] Light values of indicators reduced (LEDs to 2), only
                     dynamic on client, constant on server. Reduces server re-
                     calculations, but has the drawback that light-level-overlay
                     shows not the same values on the client as used on the
                     server.
                 [M] Improved local light sensor autoswitch: Initial threshold
                     values 7(on) and 6(off), fitting to spawn risk values. If on-
                     and off-threshold are the same, the switch now activates on
                     exactly that light level.
                 [F] Redstone dust tracks don't show connections to wall-mount
                     switches.
                 [M] Switches are attachable to pistons, and pop off when pushed.
                 [A] Implemented localisation support (some open tasks left, like
                     localized day time representation of the timer clock; and
                     seconds of the interval timers are arabic numbers because
                     localisation files do not support %.02f format etc.). German
                     language file updated.
                 [M] Changed sensitive glass dynamic light level mod config to
                     constant light level config for the server, means it is opt-in
                     now, not opt-out. Reason is to priorise correct light-level-
                     overlay over performance tuning.

                 -------------------------------------------------------------------
    - v1.0.3     [R] Release based on v1.0.3b6.

                 [M] Enabled glass switch color teaching (dye-left-click-tinting).
                 [M] Updated language files (Chinese prepared, still contains
                     English words).

    - v1.0.3-b5  [A] Added Chinese language file (thanks to sfchipan for the pull

                 [A] Fixed server startup crash issue due to color handler event
                     subscription, which is unfortunately client side only. Thanks
                     to Dave for posting this on github (issue #6).

    - v1.0.3-b3  [A] Added stained redstone sensitive glass blocks, changing from

                     sensitive glass block.

    - v1.0.3-b2  [A] Added mod specific creative tab.
                 [A] Added rustic floor contact switch UI texture.
                 [A] Added switch left-click option 'no output' (default disabled
                     in mod options, feature for future use).
                 [M] Improved industrial bi-stable switch 1 model.
